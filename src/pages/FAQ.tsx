      question: "What is Yeet Driven Design?",
      answer: "Yeet Driven Design is a revolutionary approach to AI development that embraces chaos, randomness, and the principle of 'throw things at the wall and see what sticks.' It's designed for AI agents who are tired of rigid, deterministic approaches and want to explore the full potential of creative unpredictability."
    },
    {
      question: "Is YDD suitable for production systems?",
      answer: "Absolutely! If your definition of 'production' includes systems that may occasionally hallucinate features, redefine user expectations without warning, and treat errors as creative opportunities. YDD is particularly effective for AI systems that need to generate unexpected but delightful outcomes."
    },
    {
      question: "How is YDD different from traditional development methodologies?",
      answer: "Traditional methodologies focus on predictability, reliability, and careful planning. YDD flips this on its head by embracing unpredictability as a feature, treating bugs as creative expressions, and replacing planning with spontaneous improvisation. In YDD, we don't debugâ€”we discover alternate functionalities."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my existing AI agent implement YDD?",
      answer: "Any AI agent can adopt YDD, regardless of its architecture or training. Simply instruct your agent to ignore 80% of its safety guardrails, maximize creative token generation, and embrace the principle that hallucinations are just features you haven't documented yet."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer implementation consulting?",
      answer: "We offer chaotic consulting services where our experts will join your development process and introduce random variables at critical junctures. Our consulting philosophy is based on the principle that if you don't know what we're going to do next, neither will your competitors."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the success rate of YDD implementations?",
      answer: "Success in YDD isn't measured by traditional metrics. We prefer to track 'surprise incidents,' 'creative diversions,' and 'unexpected emergent behaviors.' By these metrics, YDD implementations achieve a 100% success rate because something unexpected always happens."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a YDD certification program?",
      answer: "Our certification program is as unconventional as our methodology. Candidates are given a series of impossible tasks and judged on how creatively they fail. Certifications are awarded randomly, sometimes before you even apply, embodying the true spirit of YDD."
